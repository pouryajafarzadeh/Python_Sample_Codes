One of the most interesting concepts in the Signal and System course is Fourier Series. The main purpose of the Fourier series is to illustrate a periodic function by summation of the base sinoside function. Consequently, if we have the impulse response of the base function, we can have the response of the base periodic function to the input. For more information regarding the Fourier series and its properties, I suggest you read **Signal and Systems** [book](https://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-2nd-Alan-Oppenheim/dp/0138147574) by Oppenheim.
In the following example, I coded the reconstruction of the periodic step function (with period T = 4).
